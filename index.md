Hi, my name is Andy Zhang, and I am a 2nd year computer engineering major at the **University of California, San Diego** 
A quote that I live by is 
> Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.

Currently, I am making this page for `CSE 110`, and I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to make it.

When I am not doing school work, I have different [hobbies](#hobbies) I partake in
